# Project Name

JQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

Objective: 

To sum up employee salaries by gathering the data through the use of user input data and a table.

Layout: 

1. Inputs are created for name, last name, ID, title, and salary. Next to the inputs, a button called Add Employee is created. 

2. Below the inputs and the Add Button, a table called Data Table is created in the html file with the same headings as the inputs. 

3. Below the Data Table an h2 called Total Cost is created with a span of 0. 

jQuery functionality:

The user inputs their data in the inputs at the top of the page. When they click the Add Button, two functions are triggered:

* addEmployee function:

- Gathers all the input data
- Adds a row in the table 
- Outputs all the user data to the Data Table
- Adds a Delete Button to each row created
- Clears the values in the inputs (except for the salary input)

* calcTotal function: 

- Gathers the salary input value
- Adds it to the Total Cost
- Clears the values in the salary input






This project takes various user inputs of two diffirent types (text and number). A button is used to gather that input and place it in a table with specific headings
